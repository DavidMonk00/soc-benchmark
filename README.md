# CMS Trigger SOC Benchmarking 
This repo contains instructions for running the benchmarks: Coremark, Drhystone 2.1, and Whetstone on SOCs.  By all running these benchmarks with the same configuration we are able to make meaningful comparisons between devices.  A full discussion of these benchmarks and what their resulst mean is available in the initial [report](./Zynq Benchmarking.pdf).  

To see all results todate: <View this table?>

To contribute your own results follow these instructions:

2. [Contributing results](./SubmittingResults.md)

Optionally these instructions on [building Petalinux for a Zynq](./BuildingPetaLinux.md) may serve to help you get started or replicate our initial environment.
